<h2> Letter to future self </h2>
<p> Dear future Jeremy, dont waste your college experience on alcohol or other things that can go downhill; it may sound fun while your their but I know it will make mom feel resposible some how. Also, make sure you follow your goal on becoming fully happy with your major and life, I know college will be tough but if you stop being lazy and grow up you will be fine. Another thing buy a subaru.</p>
